## ðŸ’» About the project

Within this project, I used concepts of library, class and tests.
Throughout this program, I have understood the pillars of object-oriented programming:

### Encapsulation
- encapsulation prevents anything outside the class from directly interacting with it;
- normally, the attributes are hidden with private, and the getter and setter methods are used to interact with the attributes;
- encapsulation is intended to keep information hidden, control application data and prevent unwanted states;

### Abstraction
- the abstraction allows the program not to worry about the internal details of a method;
- this allows classes to be unbound, where an internal change does not affect the rest of the program;

### Inheritance
- classes can inherit attributes and methods from a superclass;
- with this, it is possible to assemble a hierarchy of classes, taking advantage of attributes and methods of the parent class;

### Polymorphism
- polymorphism concerns the fact that a method can have more than one implementation;
- if more than one method receives the same types of arguments, this can cause a problem in the program, since it does not necessarily present an error in the compilation;

### Built with
Apart from C#, I used the following tools to build this project.

- [VisualStudio 2019][visualstudio]
